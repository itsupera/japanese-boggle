The goal is to find as many Japanese words as possible in a grid of kana characters.

and click again to confirm the word.

## TODOs

- make timer actually work
- reset button
- change kana frequencies
- make one kana words invalid (too easy!)
- remove abbreviations from the dictionary
- history in reverse order
- put board in center, history on the side
